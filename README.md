This is a simple application I made with the goal of being able calculate the nature of the bond between two atoms given their electronegativty difference (∆EN), without the need to lookup a periodic table or calculate the EN differences manually. 

Electronegativity is generically defined as "The power of an atom, when part of a molecule, to attract electrons to itself."

The electronegatity range for each of the possiblilities varies, and this calculator can be used generally. The range used in this application is based off of the one defined in "Organic Chemistry: Integrated with Solutions Manual," by David R. Klein.

Here is a list for types of bonds and their ranges used in this application:

Covalent:        ∆EN of 0.5 or less
Polar Covalent:  ∆EN of between 0.5 and 1.7 
Ionic:           ∆EN of greater than 1.7

Simply enter the full name of each element, EN value, or any combination of name and value — the calculator will do the rest.
