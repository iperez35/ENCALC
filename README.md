This is a simple application I made with the goal of being able calculate the nature of the bond between two atoms given their electronegativty difference (∆EN). 

Electronegativity is generally defined as "The power of an atom when part of a molecule to attract eletrons to itself."

The electronegatity range for each of the possiblilities varies, and this calculator can be used generally. The range used in this application is from "Organic Chemistry: Integrated with Solutions Manual," by David R. Klein.

Here is a list for types of bonds and their ranges:

Covalent:        ∆EN of 0.5 or less
Polar Covalent:  ∆EN of between 0.5 and 1.7 
Ionic:           ∆EN of greater than 1.7

Simply enter the EN value for each atom, in any order, and the calculator will do the rest.
